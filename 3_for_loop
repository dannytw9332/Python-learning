#first block
# This part is for loop
#basic for loop

color = ["Blue","Red","Yellow"]
for x in color:
    print(x,"\n")
    
    
    
#second block
# for loop not only use on list but also work for string

a = "Watermelon"
for x in a:
    print(x)



#third block
# use dreak statement to jump out the loop

for x in color:
    print(x)
    if x == "Red":
        break


#Fourth block
# use continue statement to skip specific content

for x in color:
    if x == "Red":
        continue
    print(x)
    
    

#fifth block
# small test
# use for loop and if statement to find the smallest numberi in a list
list1 = [24,56,78,12,36,78,54,8,25,79,1,46]

# Result
smallest = None
for num in list1:
    if smallest is None or num < smallest:
        smallest = num
    print("Now",num,"smallest:",smallest)
print("smallest number is:",smallest)
